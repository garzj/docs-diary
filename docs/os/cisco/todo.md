# todo

## maybe (practice)

- macs, arp, show mac address-table
- netstat & windows commands, ipconfig
- nslookup
- auto secure? passwords min-length?
- show control-plane host open-ports
- debug/undebug
- terminal monitor
- boot system, set, flash_init, dir flash:
- `duplex full`, `speed 100`?
- `mdix auto`? crossover, etc.
- `terminal history size 200`, `show history`

## maybe (theory)

- osi model

## disable port completely

```cisco-ios title="config-if#"
shutdown
```

## OSPF

- 1.3.2 ospf states
- dr and bdr election, in every segment one
- clear ospf
- ospf priority
