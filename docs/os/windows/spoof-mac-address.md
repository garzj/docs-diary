# Spoof MAC address

Normally the MAC address of a network adapter can easily be spoofed in your `Device Manager` -> `Network Adapters` -> Right click your adapter -> `Properties` -> `Advanced` -> `Network Address`.

A spoofed MAC address should start with `X2`, `X6`, `XA` or `XE` or it might not work (`X` can be any hex digit).

If you can't find the `Network Address` field, [try this](https://superuser.com/a/1526535/1138048).
